\section*{Problem 1}

\subsection{Part 1}

If $L$ is the direction of the light source, $N$ is the normal to the surface, we know that the intensity of the light $I$ is given by
\[
I = |L| |N| cos(\alpha)
\]
where $\alpha$ is the angle between $L$ and $N$.\\
That equation is maximized when $cos(\alpha)=1$ so that $\alpha=0$\\
This means that the normal is pointing in the direction of the light source. \\
Thus the light source is in the direction of $(a,b)$.\\
To find the corresponding point on the sphere, we need to find $c$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = r^2$\\
\\
Since we are projecting the sphere onto the x-y plane, we are going to see the positive side, thus we will use the positive solution to the above equation. Thus our point on the sphere is as follows:
\[
(a,b,\sqrt{r^2-(a^2+b^2)})
\]
That vector has magnitude $r$ thus the unit vector for this point that points in the direction of the light source is as follows:
\[
(\frac{a}{r},\frac{b}{r},\frac{\sqrt{r^2-(a^2+b^2)}}{r})
\]

\subsection{Part 2}

Let $L$ be the direction of the light from $(a,b,c)$, \\
$N$ be the normal to the surface at $(a,b,c)$, and \\
$E$ be the vector pointing from $(a,b,c)$ to the viewer. \\
\\
$L$ will be the reflection vector of $E$ from the surface with normal $N$ since we have specular reflection\\
This means that 
\[
L = 2N(E \cdot N) - E
\]
INSERT DIAGRAM OF THIS\\
Let $h$ be the height with which we are viewing the sphere and $c' = c-h$, then\\
$E = (a,b,c) - (0,0,h) = (a,b,c-h) = (a,b,c')$\\
$N = \frac{1}{r}(a,b,c)$\\
We thus get
\[
L = 2 \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c c'}{r^2} (a,b,c) - (a,b,c')
\]
If we let $D = \frac{2(a^2 + b^2 + c c')}{r^2}$ then
\[
L = (a(D-1) , b(D-1), cD - c')
\]
