\section*{Problem 1}

\subsection*{Part 1}

If $L$ is the direction of the light source, $N$ is the normal to the surface, we know that the intensity of the light $I$ is given by
\[
I = |L| |N| cos(\alpha)
\]
where $\alpha$ is the angle between $L$ and $N$.\\
That equation is maximized when $cos(\alpha)=1$ so that $\alpha=0$\\
This means that the normal is pointing in the direction of the light source. \\
Thus the light source is in the direction of $(a,b)$.\\
To find the corresponding point on the sphere, we need to find $c$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = r^2$\\
\\
Since we are projecting the sphere onto the x-y plane, we are going to see the positive side, thus we will use the positive solution to the above equation. Thus our point on the sphere is as follows:
\[
(a,b,\sqrt{r^2-(a^2+b^2)})
\]
That vector has magnitude $r$ thus the unit vector for this point that points in the direction of the light source is as follows:
\[
(\frac{a}{r},\frac{b}{r},\frac{\sqrt{r^2-(a^2+b^2)}}{r})
\]

\subsection*{Part 2}

Let $L$ be the direction of the light from $(a,b,c)$, \\
$N$ be the normal to the surface at $(a,b,c)$, and \\
$E$ be the vector pointing from $(a,b,c)$ to the viewer. \\
\\
$L$ will be the reflection vector of $E$ from the surface with normal $N$ since we have specular reflection\\
As illustrated below it will hold that
\[
L + E = 2N(E \cdot N)
\]
Thus we have the formula for $L$
\[
L = 2N(E \cdot N) - E
\]

\newpage

E is parallel to the viewing direction thus \\
$E=(0,0,1)$\\
$N = \frac{1}{r}(a,b,c)$\\
We can thus say that $E \cdot N = \frac{c}{r}$, finally letting us say that
\[
L = (\frac{2ac}{r^2},\frac{2bc}{r^2},\frac{2c^2}{r^2} - 1)
\]
Now it holds that
\[
||L||_2^2 = \frac{4a^2c^2 + 4b^2c^2 + 4c^4 - 4r^2c^2 + r^4}{r^4}
\]
Factoring out $4c^2$ gives us
\[
||L||_2^2 = \frac{4c^2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - r^2) + r^4}{r^4}
\]
We know that $r^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ thus finally $||L||_2^2 = 1$\\
Proving that $L$ is a unit vector and thus in its final form
